3. **movie-this:**

4. **do-what-it-says:**

#### The application utilizes inquirer.js to create a responsive interface using a list for the first question in order to limit the response to viable options. When each option is selected a new question is created dynamically that is appropriate to the selected function.
#### chalk.js is used to provide colors for the console output.
